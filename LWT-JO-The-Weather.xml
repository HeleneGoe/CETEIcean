               AccuWeather. If you're a New Yorker you might even get your weather from New York 1's

               for the first of this month was <q>"October got off to a warm start today enjoy the

               </incident><shift feature="tempo" new="normal"/>
               <shift feature="loud" new="normal"/>But look,wherever you get your weather from if
               you live in the u.s. your forecast would not exist without the National Weather
               Service. It's a subset of its parent agency <choice>
                  <abbr>NOAA</abbr>
                  <ex>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</ex>
               </choice> and it's an absolutely incredible government service generating essential
               information but unfortunately it may be under serious threat. So tonight much like
               two colleagues in an elevator let's talk about the weather <incident>
                  <desc>[audience laughther]</desc>
               </incident> and and let's start with the fact the National Weather Service harvests a
               huge amount of data every day and all the other private weather services you can
               possibly think of are dependent on that data to make their own predictions. Here's
               one National Weather Service meteorologists pointing exactly that out</u>
         </div>
         <div type="cutaway" xml:id="CA02">
            <u who="#UP03" trans="smooth"> All the forecast warnings and data that's available from
               the National Weather Service is there free of charge to anyone even though you don't
               know our names or see our faces most of the time those products and services that you
               see almost every day likely originated from the National Weather Service office </u>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <u who="#JO" trans="smooth">Yeah and he's absolutely right. Think of it like this:
               National Weather Service data is to a weather forecast what fresh Wolverine meat is
               to Hormel chili <incident>
                  <desc>[audience laughter]</desc>
               </incident><shift feature="rhythm" new="rh"/>you can't make one without the other.
               it's the dominant ingredient there. <incident>
                  <desc>[audience laughter]</desc>
               </incident>
               <shift feature="rhythm" new="normal"/>The National Weather Service also works in
               tandem with organizations all over the world through the World Meteorological
               Organization where countries share essential weather data on a free and unrestricted
               basis. This actually works out very well for the US we receive three times more data
               back from our partners than we give them and we've really benefited from that in the
               past. For instance in 2012 the US model initially had hurricane Sandy heading out to
               the ocean while the European model showed it making a sharp left turn and hitting the
               east coast which <pause/> it did, of course it did, and because we had that early
               warning countless lives were saved. So virtually the entire world participates in a
               weather observation system that most people have never heard of and <pause/>that
               private companies benefit greatly from. Which is not to say the companies don't add
               value here because they definitely do. Among other things when a local news station
               subscribes to say a AccuWeather it gets their state-of-the-art graphics packages.
               That's something that's been a big part of their brand since at least the 80s</u>

               narrowly tailor forecasts for specific clients. For example they could tell a

                  <desc>[audience cheering]</desc>
               </incident> But Myers, Myers actually makes a pretty good case there for the value of
               private weather companies. Making sure Eddie Vedder doesn't get struck by lightning
               is simply not something the National Weather Service has the bandwidth to do. <incident>
                  <desc>[audience laughter]</desc>
               </incident> So the relationship between the public and the private sector is mutually
               beneficial. In fact sometimes the weather service even buys data from private
               companies. But there can be tensions because the private sector is by its nature
               inclined to try and grab attention like when AccuWeather rolled out its
               groundbreaking 45 day forecast despite the fact most experts agree any forecasts
               beyond seven to ten days is unreliable and one even called it a joke. <incident>
                  <desc>[audience laughter]</desc>
               </incident> And and it gets worse. For instance it is the National Weather Service
               that names tropical storms and they named them to signal that they are important. If
               a storm gets a name like Sandy or Irene then you know you've got to pay attention.
               Now they <emph>don't</emph> name winter storms because winter storms ebb and flow
               much more so naming them could inflate their importance or eventually cheapen naming
               storms altogether which is why it bugged the shit out of The Weather Service when The

               anything a private company does like providing daily forecasts or putting content on
               its website. Now the bill failed which is good because what you do not want is a
               paywall system of weather where only paying customers can find out if they're about
               to drive into a tornado. And I'm not even making up that worst case scenario it's
               basically AccuWeather's sales pitch. During that same interview where Joel Myers
               claimed that he'd saved Eddie Vedder's life he shared an anecdote about a client, a
               railroad company that pays AccuWeather to give it reports about anything affecting

               the National Weather Service also warned the town just a few minutes later giving

               AccuWeather as indispensable for public safety which thanks to the current strength
               of the National Weather Service it isn't. Freely shared information has tremendous
               potentially life-saving value although at times his brother Barry has argued

               to parlay this job into a future lobbying gig on K Street. He's a 76 year old
               multi-millionaire so he has no passion for the subject matter and his family company
               is as he himself has argued a direct competitor to the agency he's been tapped to
               run. And if that weren't disqualifying enough there is one more concern hanging over

            <u who="#JO" trans="smooth">Right the investigation said the company had a severe and
               pervasive harassment problem and while the company denies the allegations they also
               chose not to fight them. And the crazy thing here is Myers has been Trump's nominee
               for <emph>two years</emph> now but he hasn't been in the job because the Senate has
               been sitting on his confirmation. Trump's already had to resubmit his nomination
               twice and if Myers isn't confirmed by the end of this year he'll have to do it again

               </incident> Besides it has been easy for Trump to stick by Myers because hardly
               anyone has been paying attention to this issue which is understandable but we really
               should be. And I might actually know a way to help here because what better way to
               illustrate an abstract threat than by learning from the company that since the 80s
               has perfected turning dry information into state-of-the-art entertainment so please

               according to our patented thousand day forecast model superstorm Barry is going to
               cause <emph>significant harm</emph> to the National Weather Service. As you can see
               it originated over here at AccuWeather headquarters and it's been gravitating towards <choice>

               could be significant damage. I'm talking <figure type="video_graphic"
